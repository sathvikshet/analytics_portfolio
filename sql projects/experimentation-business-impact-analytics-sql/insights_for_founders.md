# 📈 Insights for Founders

## Project: Experimentation & Business Impact Analytics using SQL

This document summarizes **key insights from A/B experimentation analysis** and translates data into **clear business decisions**.

The focus is on **trust, impact, and long-term value** — not vanity metrics.

---

## 🔹 1. Experiment Quality & Trustworthiness

### 📌 What we found

* Users are evenly distributed across experiment variants
* No significant Sample Ratio Mismatch (SRM) detected
* Experiment assignment appears unbiased

### 💡 Why it matters

* Results can be **trusted**
* Observed differences are likely due to the experiment, not data issues
* Decisions based on this experiment are statistically sound

---

## 🔹 2. Conversion Performance

### 📌 What we found

* One variant outperforms the other in conversion rate
* Conversion uplift is measurable and consistent
* The improvement is not driven by sample size imbalance

### 💡 Why it matters

* Higher conversion means more users reaching value
* Even small percentage gains can compound at scale
* This metric reflects **short-term experiment success**

---

## 🔹 3. Revenue Impact

### 📌 What we found

* The winning variant generates higher total revenue
* Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) is higher in the winning variant
* Revenue uplift is observed even after normalizing per user

### 💡 Why it matters

* Confirms the experiment improves **monetization quality**
* Not just more conversions, but **better users**
* Direct financial justification for rollout

---

## 🔹 4. Retention & Long-Term Value

### 📌 What we found

* Retention rates differ between variants
* One variant retains users more effectively over time
* Retention uplift aligns with revenue performance

### 💡 Why it matters

* Retention drives lifetime value (LTV)
* Short-term gains without retention are risky
* Winning variant shows **sustainable impact**

---

## 🔹 5. Trade-Off Analysis

### 📌 What we found

* No major negative trade-offs observed
* Improved conversion does not reduce retention
* Revenue and retention move in the same direction

### 💡 Why it matters

* Safe to scale the winning variant
* Low risk of hidden long-term downsides
* Indicates strong product-market alignment

---

## 🔹 6. Business Recommendation

### ✅ Recommended Action

* Roll out the **winning variant** to 100% of users

### 🔍 Additional Suggestions

* Monitor retention over longer time windows (60–90 days)
* Re-run similar experiments on adjacent features
* Use this variant as a baseline for future tests

---

## 🔹 Final Takeaway

This experiment demonstrates:

* Clean experiment execution
* Clear business uplift
* Sustainable long-term value

The analysis supports a **confident rollout decision** backed by:

* Conversion gains
* Revenue growth
* Retention improvement
